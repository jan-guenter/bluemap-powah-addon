# Agent guide for BlueMap Powah Add-on

This is an independent public BlueMap add-on repository in the BlueMap ATMons
portfolio. Read this file and `README.md` before changing it.

## Exact baseline

- All the Mons `1.2.0`
- Minecraft `1.21.1`
- NeoForge `21.1.248`
- Java `21`
- BlueMap `5.22-agent.backport-5.22-mc1.21.1-2`
- Add-on ID `bluemap-powah`, version `0.1.0-alpha.1`

This is a standalone BlueMap add-on, not a NeoForge mod. Do not add client
classes, candidate binaries or assets, nested JARs, Minecraft classes, Mixins,
or world state.

## Development contract

- Preserve stock rendering when the exact runtime profile is absent,
  unsupported, malformed, duplicated, or disabled.
- Keep BlueMap internals isolated below the versioned adapter package.
- Keep exact candidate identities and resource contracts in the profile.
- Keep state decoding, normalized data, and mesh emission separate.
- Use bounded diagnostics and stock fallback for unknown family data.
- Keep gallery cases, renderer behavior, licensing, and provenance owned by
  this repository.
- Follow the shared `addon-v1` source style maintained by `bluemap-atmons`.

## Commands

Run the repository's documented exact-input properties, then:

```bash
gradle --no-daemon clean check build
```

Follow `docs/RELEASING.md` and the repository workflow for publication. Never
stage generated build output, candidate JARs, worlds, credentials, logs, or
local research evidence.
