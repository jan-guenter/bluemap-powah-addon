# Releasing

Release only an owner-accepted renderer from a clean reviewed commit.

1. Confirm the exact All the Mons, Minecraft, NeoForge, Java, BlueMap, and
   candidate-mod identities documented by this repository.
2. Run the repository's complete `check` and build gates with every required
   exact artifact property. Initialize the pinned toolkit with
   `git submodule update --init --recursive`; the trust preflight must pass
   from the release commit without modifying the gitlink or toolkit worktree.
3. Verify the production and sources JAR boundaries, licenses, notices, and
   provenance. Do not bundle candidate-mod binaries, resources, source,
   galleries, worlds, logs, or credentials.
4. Confirm `addon_version`, the intended Maven coordinates, and every sealed
   release size and SHA-256 value.
5. Merge through a pull request. Create an immutable annotated tag exactly
   equal to `v<addon_version>` at the reviewed commit.
6. Let `.github/workflows/release.yml` publish. Compare downloaded assets and
   checksums with the accepted local artifacts before updating
   `bluemap-atmons`.

A tooling-only conventions change does not alter `addon_version` or an
existing tag. No publication step deploys to a production server.
